*This website is a work in progress.*

## Introduction

In the medical setting, programs such as PowerChart or eRIC are often used to access and record progress notes on patients. The way these programs are deployed often make it challenging to open multiple panels of information efficiently.

In this setting, Notepad or Sticky Notes is often used as a temporary space to create progress notes which can then be copied and pasted into the electronic medical records. 

Alternatively, these programs are also used as simple tools to strip copied text of formatting.

## Rationale

This website aims to serve a similar role to Notepad or Sticky Notes in this instance, but with a few advantages. Some of these include, but are not limited to:

* Ability to restore data when the window is closed (e.g. when the computer on wheels or COW runs out of power and the computer needs to be restarted)

* Portability between different computers to facilitate the initiation of a progress note on one computer and completion on another

* The use of preformed templates

## Key features and inclusions

Further functionality may be added in the future. Currently, the aim is to include the following features.

* Plain text formating only
* Lightweight to facilitate faster loading
* Website based to allow portability of progress notes
* Compability with Internet Explorer as well as Chromium based browsers
* Automatic local storage of progress note
* Ability to backup progress note online with password protection
* Ability to manually clear progress notes stored locally and online
* Provision of templates to aid in writing progress notes

## Screenshots

To be included.

## Specific issues to be resolved

* Resizing the text area causes the margins to change? I am using `!important` to overcome this. However, I do not know the cause of this behaviour.
